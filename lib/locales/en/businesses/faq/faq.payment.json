  "answer": {
    "1": "Customers can either click a payment link (e.g., a “Pay Now” button) that directs them to the FLIZpay app or scan a QR code with their smartphone - from within the FLIZpay app or the phone’s camera. The payment process then follows the same steps in both scenarios. If a customer has not yet used FLIZpay, the system automatically detects this and guides them through a quick, one-minute onboarding. Customers don’t have to use our app - they can also pay from the browser. Once customers confirm the payment, FLIZpay initiates an Instant SEPA transfer from the customer’s bank account in the background. The funds go directly to the company’s linked bank account - FLIZpay never holds or processes the money itself. Until October 2025, a small number of banks may not support Instant SEPA transfers. In such cases, FLIZpay simply falls back on a standard SEPA transfer.",
    "2": "Yes. Once you sign up for a company account, you can use our app to accept in-person payments. You can also assign sub-accounts to employees, enabling them to accept FLIZ payments and receive payment confirmations on their phones. But that’s not all - our QR codes can also be used in printed form.",
    "3": "No. Instant SEPA transfers are very fast bank transfers handled through the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) network. SEPA direct debits, on the other hand, also run through this network but are initiated by the receiving party - giving payers an eight-week window to request a refund. Since Instant SEPA transfers are triggered by the paying party, there’s no refund option.",
    "4": "They simply connect their existing bank account to FLIZpay. All German banks and popular foreign banks are supported. No extra card or topping up the app is necessary. They can pay directly in the browser or (even easier) with our app.",
    "5": "FLIZ is currently designed for payments by private customers. A dedicated solution for business-to-business payments may be added in the future.",
    "6": "Currently, FLIZpay does not offer chargebacks."
